summary: "my thoughts about ai."
---

recently i saw a lot of ai content on youtube especially developing web apps with ai. as a web developer, i think we are fucked up really bad. yeah. people make fucking apps with the v0, cursor and other “good” ai. and the funniest thing about the whole situation is, i am a high school student. i dont have a degree, like its not the most important thing but. yeah, i dont have one. 

i was talking the ai thing with a stranger i met in a cafe few weeks ago and i said, “the success rate of its is really low, it cant make a whole project”. as today, i was wrong.

i saw people making a whole ai saas startup with no-code, only ai, and making money on it. like i said as a web developer and a entrepreneur it really surprised me. 

dont come to me, i follow the news obviously but, i was really busy for few weeks… 

and yeah, i published this website.. my lazy ass didnt wanted to make an actual design and code it entirely, so, i used a magicui template. and this sections heading are “my thoughts” and it is actually are. im randomly writing things, its 12am right now.

welcome to my world
